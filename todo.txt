# Migration of christiankozalla.com to Github pages

# aka teardown Contabo VPS

## Running on legacy Contabo VPS

- christiankozalla.com ::MIGRATED::

- stock-trends.christiankozalla.com 
    Dependencies: Python backend, Daily cron job, Deno, static React frontend

- seaty.christiankozalla.com - completely static - not a MUST HAVE (Github repo enough)

- its.christiankozalla.com - migrate IF THERE IS TIME to another VPS. Make a DEMO ACCOUNT which has some dummy data inside..
    Or make some proper screenshots and put them on the repos README

- calendar app -> no need, because it is the outdated web-based frontend

---> Remove links to those projects from CV
